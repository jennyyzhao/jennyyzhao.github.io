subtitle: Why I chose to take this class

I have always been really interested in technology and the internet. As a self-proclaimed iPad kid, sometimes I find the digital world to be a bit more entertaining and fullfilling to spend time on compared to going outside. But that's probably because I'm from Florida where the weather is like a bajillion degrees all the time. As a first year who is still undecided in what they want to major in, I figured that I might as well take full advantage of the liberal arts cirriculum that is offered here at Williams College and try out a class on computer science. What I found really interesting about this course was how even though it was a class with a computer science prefix, there were going to be a lot of physical elements involved such as sewing which challenged my preconceived notions of what a computer science class should look like. Regardless, I'm very excited to be in the class and hope to leave with skills that will be applicable for the rest of my life!
