##### Name
Jenny Zhao

##### Year
Class of 2029, first year!

##### Major
Undecided

##### Sewing Experience
Not much, the most I have ever done is patch a hole in a shirt after following a YouTube tutorial. Sewing machines still scare me through. 

##### Programming Experience
None. 

##### Learning Hops
I hope how to learn how to become a better creator of things, both digital and physical, by learning how to code and how to sew. 

##### Boring Facts
I have never owned any pets before. Hopefully this will change in the future.
